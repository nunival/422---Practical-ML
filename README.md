# MSDS 422 - Practical Machine Learning

**Course Decription:**
The course introduced machine learning with business applications. It provided a survey of machine learning techniques, including traditional statistical methods, resampling techniques, model selection and regularization, tree-based methods, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, artificial neural networks, and deep learning. We implemented machine learning models with open-source software for data science. We explored data, found underlying patterns useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification.
